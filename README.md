Description : 

The email spam detection web application allows users to input an email message through a simple web interface. Upon submission, the application preprocesses the text by removing unnecessary characters and tokenizing it into individual words. This cleaned data is then converted into a numerical format suitable for analysis. The processed text is fed into a trained Naive Bayes classification model, which identifies patterns associated with spam and legitimate emails based on its training with a labeled dataset. The model predicts whether the email is spam or ham (legitimate) and provides the user with an instant result along with a probability score indicating the confidence level of the classification.
